# Automated EC2 provisioning and Dockerized app deployment using Terraform, Docker Compose, Ansible, and AWS dynamic inventory for scalable infrastructure delivery.


Overview:
Implemented an automated pipeline for provisioning EC2 instances and deploying Dockerized applications on AWS using Terraform, Ansible, Docker Compose, and AWS dynamic inventory. Terraform scripts provisioned scalable EC2 infrastructure, while Ansible automated configuration management and application deployment. Docker Compose orchestrated multi‑service containers, streamlining application delivery and ensuring consistency across environments. AWS dynamic inventory enabled adaptive scaling and resource management. This IaC‑driven approach reduced manual intervention, improved deployment reliability, and delivered production‑ready infrastructure aligned with DevOps best practices.
